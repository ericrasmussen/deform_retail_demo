Deform Retail Form Demos
========================

This is a pyramid site designed to show off deform retail form rendering.

This new feature makes deform much easier to use on sites with heavily
customized forms, but since the feature isn't in wide use (as of 5/23/2013, at
least) I wanted to make it known.

I am very open to adding new example forms so please feel free to issue pull
requests or submit ideas on the github issue tracker.
