Simple deform demo to show off deform "retail" form rendering.

This new feature makes deform much easier to use on sites with heavily
customized forms, but since the feature isn't in wide use (as of 5/23/2013, at
least!) I wanted to show it off.

The official docs are here: http://deform.readthedocs.org/en/latest/retail.html
